# Notifications: in-app toast + real push

## Files / functions
- `src/screens/Notifications.jsx:1-76` — full-screen inbox list, pull-only (no toast anywhere in `src/`)
- `src/state/GocContext.jsx:1521-1535` `loadNotifications()`/`goNotifications()` — fetches once at sign-in + once per screen-open, no poll, no realtime
- `apps/ios/BanbeApp/State/AppState+Data.swift:356` `loadNotifications()`, `:351` `goNotifications()` — identical pattern, no local notifications (`UNUserNotificationCenter` grep: zero hits repo-wide)
- `apps/ios/BanbeApp/Views/HomeView.swift:104-135` `PhaseBanner` / `src/screens/Home.jsx:167-198` — persistent status banners, NOT ephemeral toasts (different concept, pre-existing)
- `api/telegram-webhook.js`, `api/cron/escalate-verifications.js`, `public.alert_outbox`/`v_alert_queue` (026:925-982) — organizer-only Telegram alert channel, confirmed intentional stopgap (note 02) for organizers without the app open; never used for the guest

## DB: server-side `notifications` INSERTs that already exist (kind values)
`booking_requested` (026:416), `payment_confirmed`/QR issued (026:707), `payment_disputed` (033:197), `payment_needs_info` (041:87), `dispute_resolved` (047:86), `hold_expired` (028:77), `verification_reminder`/`verification_escalation` (026:958,981), `booking_cancelled` (022:173), `referral_joined` (023:111)

## Gap found: dispute chat message has no notification row at all
`send_dispute_message()` (044:67-105) inserts into `dispute_messages` only — no `notifications` row for the other party. Every other event type above already has a row written server-side.

## Real push infra: NONE
Zero references anywhere (`push_token`/`device_token`/`apns`/`firebase`/`onesignal`/`UNUserNotificationCenter` all grepped, zero hits) — no device-token table/column, no APNs key reference, no push-sending service.

## Status: BROKEN (client never surfaces any notification proactively)
Every event type that already writes a `notifications` row is invisible to a user unless they manually open the bell/Notifications screen — no toast, no badge refresh, no poll. Same root pattern as the "Going" list bug fixed in 04-admin-escalation.md (fetch-once, no invalidation), but here there was never even a UI surface for it beyond the pull screen.

## TODO / open questions
- Toast fix below uses polling (this repo has no realtime channels anywhere, by established convention — see 03-dispute-chat.md) — 5s interval chosen to match existing poll conventions (4s dispute chat, 6s payment status).
- Push (Step 3): token capture + storage wired; APNs send itself blocked on a real `.p8` key — see report for exact credential needed.

## 2026-09-15 — fixed: toast system (web+iOS) + dispute-message notification + push scaffold

**Fixes**: `src/state/GocContext.jsx` (toasts state + `pushToast`, poll rewritten around a `sessionStart` timestamp rather than "seen last poll" — the latter has a real race: a row inserted while the first poll's request is still in flight was already present in that first response and so got marked "already seen," never toasting), `src/screens/ToastStack.jsx` (new), `src/App.jsx`, `src/index.css:gocToastIn/gocToastOut`. iOS mirrors: `AppState.swift` (`toasts`, `pushToast` with `.light` haptic), `AppState+Data.swift` (`startNotificationPolling`/`stopNotificationPolling`, same `sessionStart` fix), `apps/ios/BanbeApp/Views/ToastOverlay.swift` (new), `RootView.swift`.

**Migration** `20260915000048_048_dispute_message_notification.sql`: `send_dispute_message()` now inserts a `notifications` row for whoever didn't send it (guest + both organizer accounts, minus sender/NULLs) — closes the one gap found in Step 1.

**Push (Step 3)**: `20260915000049_049_device_push_tokens.sql` (table + `register_push_token()` RPC, upsert-by-token). iOS: `AppDelegate.swift` (new, wired via `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` in `BanbeApp.swift`) captures the real device token; `AppState+Push.swift` (new) requests permission + calls the RPC. `BanbeApp.entitlements` (new) + `project.yml`'s `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` declare `aps-environment` — compiles and runs (`xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild`, BUILD SUCCEEDED) but cannot receive a real push without a Development Team + real APNs Auth Key, neither of which exist in this project yet. Nothing server-side sends anything yet — no credential to send with.

**Tests**: `tests/notifications-toast.spec.js` (new) — inserts a `notifications` row via service role for a signed-in real test user, confirms a toast appears within one poll cycle and disappears on its own. Passes reliably in isolation on all 3 browsers; flaky when run in the same parallel batch as `dispute-flow-e2e.spec.js` (both hit the same live backend from real browsers, competing for CPU/network under this sandbox's default parallelism) — reliable with `--workers=1`, not a product bug (confirmed by isolated reruns).

vite build clean; iOS `xcodebuild` BUILD SUCCEEDED; 270/270 non-real-backend Playwright tests pass; both real-backend suites pass with `--workers=1`.
